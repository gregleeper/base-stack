# Room Scheduling Web Software

A modern web application for room scheduling built with React Router v7 and Hono server.

## Project Overview

This project is a room scheduling web application that allows users to manage and book rooms efficiently. It leverages the latest web technologies to provide a fast, responsive, and user-friendly experience.

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies

- **React Router v7**: A multi-strategy router for React applications
- **Hono Server**: A fast, lightweight web framework that runs on multiple JavaScript runtimes
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first CSS styling

## Project Architecture

This project follows a modern web application architecture with React for the frontend and Hono for the server. It's set up to enable server-side rendering and data loading through React Router's framework capabilities.

### Key Features of the Setup

- **React Router v7 Framework Mode**: Provides advanced features like data loading, server-side rendering, and nested routing
- **Hono Server Integration**: Lightweight server with excellent performance
- **Internationalization Support**: Built-in using i18next
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing through TypeScript
- **Fast Development Experience**: Hot module replacement via Vite

### Key Files

- **vite.config.ts**: Configures the development environment with plugins for React Router, Hono Server, and other tools
- **react-router.config.ts**: Configures React Router's framework features
- **app/server/index.ts**: Sets up the Hono server with middleware and context
- **app/routes/**: Contains the route components that define the application's pages

## React Router v7 Features

This project takes advantage of React Router v7's framework capabilities, including:

- **Data Loading**: Server-side data fetching with loaders
- **Form Actions**: Server-side form processing
- **Nested Routing**: Shared layouts with nested pages
- **Type Safety**: First-class types for route params, loader data, and actions

## Hono Server Integration

The project uses the `react-router-hono-server` package to integrate React Router with a Hono server. This provides:

- **Fast Server**: Hono is an ultrafast web framework
- **Middleware Support**: For authentication, logging, etc.
- **Multi-Runtime Support**: Works on Node.js, Cloudflare Workers, Bun, etc.
- **Web Standards**: Built on standard web APIs

## Development Environment

The development environment is powered by:

- **Vite**: Fast bundling and development server
- **Hot Module Replacement**: Quick updates without full page reloads
- **TypeScript**: Strong typing and modern JavaScript features
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **React Compiler**: Optimizes React components for production

## Getting Started

To start working on this project:

1. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `pnpm install`
2. Start the development server: `npm run dev` or `pnpm dev`
3. Build for production: `npm run build` or `pnpm build`
4. Start the production server: `npm run start` or `pnpm start`

## Next Steps

As we continue to build the room scheduling application, we'll need to:

1. Design the data model for rooms and bookings
2. Create UI components for the scheduling interface
3. Implement authentication and authorization
4. Develop APIs for room management and booking
5. Add features like notifications and calendar integration
